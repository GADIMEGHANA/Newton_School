#There are N tasks waiting in line to be executed. The execution time for the ith task is Aiâ€‹ seconds. Ram has two processors to execute these N tasks. Both these processors work simultaneously. Each processor executes the assigned tasks one by one.Ram assigns a prefix of these tasks to the first processor and the remaining tasks to the second processor.
# For example, if there are 3 tasks, Ram can do one of the following:

# Assign no task to the first processor. This means, the second processor will execute tasks 1,2 and 3.
# Assign task 1 to the first processor. This means, the second processor will execute tasks 2 and 3.
# Assign tasks 1 and 2 to the first processor. This means, the second processor will execute task 3.
# Assign tasks 1,2 and 3 to the first processor. Thus, second processor would execute no tasks.
